       git - the stupid content tracker

SYNOPSIS
       git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p|--paginate|-P|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>]
           <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see giteveryday(7) for a useful minimum set of commands. The Git User’s Manual[1] has a more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help
       command". gitcli(7) manual page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.

       A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html or https://git-scm.com/docs.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is given then all available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this
           option will bring up the manual page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See git-help(1) for more information, because git --help ...  is converted internally into git help
           ....

       -C <path>
           Run as if git was started in <path> instead of the current working directory. When multiple -C options are given, each subsequent non-absolute -C <path> is interpreted
           relative to the preceding -C <path>. If <path> is present but empty, e.g.  -C "", then the current working directory is left unchanged.

           This option affects options that expect path name like --git-dir and --work-tree in that their interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working
           directory caused by the -C option. For example the following invocations are equivalent:

               git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
               git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will override values from configuration files. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by git
           config (subkeys separated by dots).
